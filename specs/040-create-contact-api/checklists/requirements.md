## Notes

- "TenantContact" (data model name) vs "renter contact" (spec language) distinction documented in Assumptions to avoid confusion with Clerk org-level Tenant.
- Email uniqueness is case-insensitive — documented in Assumptions and FR-004.
- Soft-delete explicitly out of scope (deferred to US 12.5) — noted in Assumptions and FR-013.
- Cross-workspace uniqueness is intentionally NOT enforced — explicit in FR-005 and US3 scenario 2.
